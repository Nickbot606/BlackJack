# BlackJack (Python)
Just made a fun python script in blackjack. Keeps track of wins and losses as well as 1 dollar bets with doubling down and standing and hitting working so far. More features soon I promise!

#TODO
1. Fix the Splitting!
2. Refactor and split the scripts into different parts
3. Add table stratedgies
4. Have breakdown of each win card loss with each Player in a readable file format
5. Maybe first machine learning project?
